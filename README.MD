## [Jenkins & Sonarqube Pipeline](./jenkins/README.MD)

Jenkins & Sonarqube pipeline for a Maven project. Jacoco is used for code coverage and the 
results are published to the Sonarqube server. After everything is finished we send the results 
to slack and e-mail accordingly.

## [Grafana Loki & Promtail](./grafana-loki/README.MD)

Grafana Loki & Promtail for log aggregation and visualization. Wanted to practice getting logs
